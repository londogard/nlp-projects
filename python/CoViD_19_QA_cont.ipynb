    "# CoViD-19 FAQ Search Engine 2.0\n",
    "As promised I deliver here a new improved edition off the FAQ engine. Just as previously I keep the same conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The end-product must be unsupervised\n",
    "  - No manually annotated data\n",
    "  - No heuristic applied (at least in first iteration)\n",
    "- It should be light enough to run on a Raspberry Pi later on (hopefully on the JVM to keep it simple with my back-end)\n",
    "- Must be Swedish all the way through - no translations (English models you can transfer knowledge from tends to be stronger, but I want to keep this fun!)\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's continue on the implementation from previously!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements to be done\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous [blog](https://londogard.com/blog/4) / [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/londogard/nlp-projects/blob/master/python/CoViD_19_QA.ipynb) I showed improvements by going from 'Word Embedding Averaging' to 'SIF' (Smooth Inverse Frequency).  \n",
    "To improve further there is a few low hanging fruits to be grabbed, the first one being lower-casing the text. Further it is worth trying lemmatizing, using a better tokenization and stop-words. In total I figured the following worthy of checking out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lowercase\n",
    "- Better tokenization\n",
    "- Lemmatizing\n",
    "- Custom features (e.g. found a swear-word etc?)\n",
    "- Stop words\n",
    "- Ngram & custom embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to make it even better I'd say we need annotated data where we can make use of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Prettify\n",
    "- [ ] Show improvement through\n",
    "- [ ] Average -> FSE\n",
    "- [ ] Split -> Stanza tokenization\n",
    "- [ ] Cased -> Lowercase\n",
    "- [ ] Lemmatizing ???\n",
    "- [ ] Stop words ???\n",
    "- [ ] Supervised required to get further!"
